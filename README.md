# animatronics-controller
Simple arduino based animatronics controller

Supports up to 2 triggers (ultrasonic or IR beam break sensors) and up to 8 devices that can be assigned to either trigger with programmable activation delay.  
Any animatronic or device that can be triggered by a simple button (eg stomp pad, try me button, etc) should be controllable via relay with this project.

The comments in the arduino code should be enough to figure out the wiring, but tutorial video link will go here when done.

I 3D printed a couple of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1170335 in a nice orange to house my sensors, with everything sealed with some hot glue, they hold up in mild rain/snow.
