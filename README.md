# animatronics-controller
Simple arduino based animatronics controller

Supports up to 2 triggers (ultrasonic or IR beam break sensors) and up to 8 devices that can be assigned to either trigger with programmable activation delay.  
Any animatronic or device that can be triggered by a simple button (eg stomp pad, try me button, etc) should be controllable via relay with this project.
